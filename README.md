We've choosen the [Evil corp kata](https://github.com/Gianfrancoalongi/incremental_katas/tree/master/Evil_Corp) because it's incremental and funny. The advantage of this kata is that you remove the difficulty that comes from having to choose which is the next test to write. Here the rules we've set for the session:

- Proceed one requirements at a time. Don't cheat
- Strictly implement what's asked. Try to not anticipate design
- Regex are forbidden (for your own safety :-)
- Slow down. Focus on doing it right
